# DUO

An HTTP/2 Server written purely in Crystal

HTTP/2 is binary, instead of textual. HTTP/2 is fully multiplexed. This means that HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection. This is the most advanced feature of the HTTP/2 protocol because it allows you to download web files via ASync mode from one server.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     duo:
       github: eliasjpr/duo
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

```crystal
require "duo"
```

## Server Example

```crystal
require "../src/duo"

class EchoHandler
  include Duo::Server::Handler

  def call(context : Duo::Server::Context)
    request, response = context.request, context.response
    context.response << "Hello World!"
    context
  end
end

class NotFoundHandler
  include Duo::Server::Handler

  def call(context : Duo::Server::Context)
    response = context.response
    response.status = 404
    response.headers["server"] = "h2/0.0.0"
    response.headers["content-type"] = "text/plain"
    response << "404 NOT FOUND\n"
  end
end

ssl_context = OpenSSL::SSL::Context::Server.new
ssl_context.certificate_chain = File.join(__DIR__, "ssl", "example.crt")
ssl_context.private_key = File.join(__DIR__, "ssl", "example.key")
ssl_context.alpn_protocol = "h2"

host = ENV["HOST"]? || "::"
port = (ENV["PORT"]? || 9876).to_i

handlers = [
  EchoHandler.new,
  NotFoundHandler.new,
]
server = Duo::Server.new(host, port, ssl_context)

if ssl_context
  puts "listening on https://#{host}:#{port}/"
else
  puts "listening on http://#{host}:#{port}/"
end
server.listen(handlers)

```

## Client Example 

```crystal
require "socket"
require "openssl"
require "./src/connection"

Log.for("Duo(Duo)").level = Log::Severity::Debug

client = Duo::Client.new("localhost", 9876, !!ENV["TLS"]?)

10.times do |i|
  headers = HTTP::Headers{
    ":method"    => "GET",
    ":path"      => "/",
    "user-agent" => "crystal h2/0.0.0",
  }

  client.request(headers) do |headers, body|
    puts "REQ ##{i}: #{headers.inspect}"

    while line = body.gets
      puts "REQ ##{i}: #{line}"
    end
  end
end

client.close
```
